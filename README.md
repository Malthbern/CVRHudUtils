# CVRHudUtils

This mod does 3 things,
# Prefix Patch
Prefix patches on the hud popup to SKIP the "Skeletal Input changed" popup when you press the A button on a left index controller
# IEnumerators
One is for Spotify Song title grabbing to throw up as as hud message, it gets this information from the window title of spotify, 
and will not work with browser or other music platforms.
The other is time utils and will go off every hour static whatever your local time is.

This modification is not supported nor am I in any way affiliated with ABI.
